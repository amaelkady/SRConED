# SRConED
SRConED is an interactive interface for exploring and processing a recently-collated comprehensive experimental database for bare steel and composite semi-rigid (SR) connections. The current version of the database (v1.0) include data for flush end-plate connections (FEP) covering more than 360 tests from 60 experimental programs. Data for other SR connections will be rolled out in future versions.
